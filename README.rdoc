If shit gets fucked up and you need to install this without me, find a rails host
running rails 1.9.2 and Rails 3

then just git clone from the website(there's a button)

cd to the directory

type in

    $ bundle install

then 

    $ rails s

and it should launch the server. Good luck! Note that the page should be served on a normal computer

by opening public/index.html on any web browser.
